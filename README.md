### About Me

I help organizations modernize legacy platforms, design scalable API architectures, and unlock business value through **AI-driven automation**. My work bridges the gap between complex enterprise data and modern, agentic user experiences.

**My Focus Areas:**
* AI & MCP Integration: Building agentic systems that transform how teams interact with enterprise data.
* Platform Modernization: Migrating monolithic architectures to event-driven microservices.
* Salesforce Integration: Connecting CRM ecosystems to modern tech stacks at scale.
* API Design: Crafting resilient, well-documented APIs that accelerate development velocity.

### What I'm Building

### Intelligent Lending Gateway
*Architecting a FastAPI-based intelligence layer that orchestrates real-time AI decisioning between Salesforce and lending microservices.*

* **The Problem:** Static, rule-based legacy systems that slow down borrower approvals and fail to detect sophisticated fraud patterns.
* **The Solution:** A centralized decisioning engine leveraging ML models for automated underwriting, predictive risk assessment, and instant loan servicing.
* **Key Features:** Sub-second model inference, agentic fraud detection, and transparent observability for regulatory compliance (Fair Lending/ECOA).
